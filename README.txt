In order to successfully run the web application you need to run the flask server before the java project.
> Go into python_files
>Double Click on flask_api.py  *not main.py*
> Wait for the python shell to print 'MODEL BUILT'
> Then run the java project.

Note: The runner system needs to have python 3.6 or above and Flask library installed
If you don't have Flask already installed open cmd or any terminal and run
> pip install flask
> pip3 install flask (for linux)
